I want to build a deal flow analyzer app for real estatate investment. 

Here's what I am thinking.

I want to start by downloading the real estate listings for a "buybox" the user definess.

For now, it can be a config. EVentually it will need to support all listings in the US.

Download all listing infromation from rapidapi - URL below - 
https://rapidapi.com/apimaker/api/zillow-com1/playground/apiendpoint_93602987-7c54-426d-94f3-1fce926b3ebb

Let me know if you want me to upload the specs for the API params, and i can do that.

I also have an API key to use this API.

Once thats done, for each listing I want to compute cash flow.

We can assusme certain configs for mortgage rate, operating expensess (like property management, maintenance fees, prop taxes) etc for the calculations. I also want to calculate the long term cassh flow, and profitability etc to display appreciation.

Overall, I envision this to be a batch proces that runs every day, and resultss queryable through a web app.

A guidance for this project, I want to keep things simple, and work on thiss very incrementally.

## Summary

This is a real estate deal flow analyzer that will:

1. **Data Collection**: Download real estate listings from Zillow API for user-defined geographic areas ("buybox")
2. **Analysis Engine**: Calculate cash flow, profitability, and long-term appreciation for each property
3. **Automation**: Run as a daily batch process to keep data fresh
4. **Web Interface**: Provide queryable results through a web application

The core value proposition is automating the tedious process of analyzing multiple real estate deals by calculating key investment metrics at scale.

## Clarifying Questions

### Data & API
1. **Geographic Scope**: When you say "buybox" - do you mean specific zip codes, cities, counties, or custom geographic boundaries? Should users be able to define multiple buyboxes?
In the future yes. As a P0, sstart with a list of zip codes.


2. **API Limitations**: What are the rate limits and pricing structure for the Zillow API? How many listings can we realistically fetch per day?
We can figure this out as we sscale. For now assume a 100 query limit per day. 

3. **Data Freshness**: How often do listings change? Is daily refresh sufficient, or do we need more frequent updates?
For P0, daily. Eventually hourly, or hooking in to some events.

4. **Historical Data**: Do you want to track price changes over time, or just current snapshot analysis?
For P0, just current snapshot analysius.

### Financial Calculations
5. **Mortgage Assumptions**: Should mortgage rates be user-configurable or use current market rates? What about down payment percentages?
All user configurable. No need for any additional external intergations at all for P0.


6. **Operating Expenses**: What specific expense categories should we include? (Property management %, maintenance %, insurance, HOA fees, vacancy rates, etc.)
All of it. Make meaningful assumptions


7. **Tax Considerations**: Should we include tax benefits like depreciation, or focus on pre-tax cash flow?
Pre-tax cash flow

8. **Appreciation Modeling**: How should we model long-term appreciation? Historical averages, market projections, or user-defined assumptions?
User defined configs. Like 3% yearly appreciation


### Technical Architecture
9. **Database**: What type of database are you thinking? SQL for structured data, or NoSQL for flexibility?
For now, lets just assume json files stored locally. We can scale this eventually.


10. **Deployment**: Are you planning to deploy this locally, on cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure), or as a SaaS product?
Maybe on heroku?


11. **User Management**: Will this be single-user initially, or do you want multi-user support from the start?
Single user. I am building this for myself. We can expand in the future.

### User Experience
12. **Filtering & Sorting**: What are the most important ways users will want to filter/sort properties? (Cash flow, ROI, location, property type, etc.)
Just zip codes for P0.


13. **Alerts**: Should users be able to set up alerts for properties meeting certain criteria?
Eventually. Not for P0.


14. **Export**: Do you want users to be able to export results to CSV/Excel?
Oh yeah..

## Additional Clarifying Questions

### MVP Scope & Priorities
15. **Property Types**: Should we focus on single-family homes, condos, multi-family, or all types? Any exclusions?
All of them. Make them configurable in a buybox config definition.


16. **Rental Estimates**: How should we estimate rental income? Use Zillow's rent estimates, or calculate based on local market data?
I have static rental data from HUD we can use. 


17. **Property Filters**: Any minimum/maximum criteria for properties to analyze? (e.g., price range, square footage, year built)
User configurable

18. **Error Handling**: How should we handle properties with missing data (e.g., no rental estimate, incomplete property details)?
Track them sseparately. I assume this will be critical as we fix issues with our solultion.


### User Interface
19. **Dashboard Layout**: What's the most important information to show first? List view, map view, or summary cards?
Simple tabular view for now.


20. **Property Details**: How detailed should the property view be? Just key metrics or full property information?
Key metrics, with a link to the property lissting on zillow


21. **Configuration UI**: Should users be able to modify financial assumptions through the web interface, or just via config files?

Just static config files. I am the only user for it now. 

### Development Approach
22. **API Documentation**: Do you have the Zillow API documentation handy? We'll need to understand the exact request/response format.
23. **Testing Strategy**: Should we start with mock data first, or go straight to the real API?
24. **Deployment Timeline**: Are you looking to have a working prototype in days, weeks, or months?
