# Cursor Rules for Deal Flow Analyzer Project

## Git Operations Policy
- **NEVER run git commands automatically** (git add, git commit, git push, etc.)
- Only run git operations when explicitly requested by the user
- Always ask for permission before committing or pushing changes
- Let the user control when changes are committed and pushed to GitHub

## Development Guidelines
- Keep the .gitignore file simple and focused on what we actually need to exclude
- Use consistent port configuration (Backend: 8000, Frontend: 8001)
- Follow TypeScript best practices with strict type checking
- Use Zod for data validation and type safety
- Maintain clean, readable code with proper error handling

## Project Structure
- Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- Frontend: Next.js + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Shared: Common types and utilities with Zod validation
- Configuration: JSON files with validation schemas
- Data Storage: JSON files in organized directory structure

## Code Quality
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow the existing code patterns and conventions
- Test functionality before considering it complete

## Communication
- Be explicit about what changes are being made
- Explain the reasoning behind technical decisions
- Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear
- Provide clear summaries of completed work
